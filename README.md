## Voidgen (For simple & explicit Game Development)

Voidgen is a personal attempt to create a game engine/framework based on Odin and the Vulkan API. 

## Build (Windows only, Linux build script is planned)
If you have the vulkan sdk installed on your machine you should build the project by simple running 

<code>.\build.bat</code>
